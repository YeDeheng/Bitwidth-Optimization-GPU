Install Gappa and CUDA first. 

We use CUDA-7.5 and a modified version of Gappa. 

# Interval GPU Project

# For image and finance benchmarks, such as Sobel, DCT, Gaussian Blur, see CUDA official sample documents as reference. 


1. First run prep_bench.sh whenever you add new benchmarks
2. We should run range.sh and prune.sh to get range and bitwidth limits for the benchmarks.

0. stuff.sh and sizes.sh prepare data to be used for plotting -- they calculate benchmark paramters.
