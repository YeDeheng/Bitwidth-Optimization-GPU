{"name":"BitGPU","tagline":"GPU-Accelerated High-Level Synthesis for Bitwidth Optimization of FPGA Datapaths","body":"### BitGPU\r\nBitGPU is a GPU approach to solve the bitwidth optimization problem. \r\n\r\nBitwidth optimization of FPGA datapaths can save hardware resources by choosing the fewest number of bits required for each datapath variable to achieve a desired quality of result. However, it is an NP-hard problem that requires unacceptably long runtimes when using sequential CPU-based heuristics. We show how to parallelize the key steps of bitwidth optimization on the GPU by performing a fast brute-force search over a carefully constrained search space. We develop a high-level synthesis methodology suitable for rapid prototyping of bitwidth-annotated RTL code generation.\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\nThis project is contributed by [Dr. Nachiket Kapre](http://nachiket.github.io/) and his PhD student [Deheng Ye](http://yedeheng.weebly.com/). \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
